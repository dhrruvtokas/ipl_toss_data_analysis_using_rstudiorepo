# Structure

This specific Github repository consists of a r code file which contains all the code which was used to deploy this application, any changes to this shiny application can be done by modifing that R code.

# Overview

Analyzing the number of matches played by the IPL teams using R Code, the relationship between several factors such as cities, seasons, game toss as well as total innings were identified and visualized to highlight some meaningful information which can be used by potential data analyst for making cricket related predictions.

# Project installation

The r shiny file requires either R Studio (with the latest R version) or jupyter notebook to function all of its operations.

# Working

1. Visualization Tabs: The application consists of total 7 different visaulization tabs and a dataset tab whoch contains the dataset related information.
2. Controls: Each visualization tab has a set of controls which lets you interact with the visualizations for example you can either change the color or the size of graphical elements.
3. Response Time Since it takes time to deploy the application on the shiny server, you might record a delay of 2 to 4 seconds between the visualizations. 

# Technologies

1. R Studio: R Studio was used for this application, and it can be installed and used to make any changes to the r code file.
2. R Shiny: R shiny was  used to create a single panel which will incorporate different visualizations.

# Required Libraries

1. For visualizations: plotly and ggplot2.
2. For creating a Shiny Application: shiny.
3. For Creating Data Tables: DT.
4. For using features like %>% : dplyr.
5. For creating severalgrids in the same section: grid and gridExtra.
